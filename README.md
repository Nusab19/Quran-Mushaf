# Quran Mushaf

## Note: Still under active development




## Running Locally

Make sure you have the default mushaf in the data folder like this:
```bash
├───data
│       almadinah-kabir-azraq.pdf
│
└───src
        main.py
        requirements.txt
```
If you don't have the pdf, download it from [here](https://github.com/The-Quran-Project/Quran-Mushaf/releases/tag/resource-files).

Then,
```bash
cd src
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```


And you'll have a `dist` folder created.
